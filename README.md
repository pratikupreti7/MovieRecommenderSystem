## About the project :

Project consisting of a content-based and collaborative recommendation system using
Movielens(100k) dataset. Used similarity matrix for content-based and used

## Why Recommender System:
If you’re running a successful business, you could probably survive without a
recommender system. However, if you want to leverage the power of data to
create a better user experience and to increase earnings, you should seriously
consider implementing one.
Is it worth investing in a good recommendation system? A good way to answer
this question is to look at how companies that have implemented such systems
have fared:

● 35% of the purchases on Amazon are the result of their recommender
system, according to McKinsey.

● During the Chinese global shopping festival of November 11, 2016,
Alibaba achieved growth of up to 20% of their conversion rate using
personalized landing pages, according to Alizila.

● Recommendations are responsible for 70% of the time people spend
watching videos on YouTube.

● 75% of what people are watching on Netflix comes from
recommendations, according to McKinsey.

● Employing a recommender system enables Netflix to save around $1
billion each year.

Therefore, we see the need of why the recommender system is a great
addition to both user and the company.
